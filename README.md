# Credit-Card-Challenge

This is a model to predict whether a given credit card would default or not. The dataset and the test cases provided had some peculiar features, most notable of all were the very small differences between those credit cards that defaulted and those that didn't. I had to learn about many new techniques and concepts to overcome these difficulties and make good use of the dataset to develop an accurate model. I have explained the process behind the development of this model in great detail in the Solution_Description.pdf file.
